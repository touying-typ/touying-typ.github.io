# Sections and Subsections

## Structure

Like Beamer, Touying also has the concept of sections and subsections.

Generally, first-level, second-level, and third-level headings correspond to sections, subsections, and subsubsections, respectively, such as in the dewdrop theme.

```typst
#import "@preview/touying:0.6.1": *
#import themes.dewdrop: *

#show: dewdrop-theme.with(aspect-ratio: "16-9")

= Section

== Subsection

=== Title

Hello, Touying!
```

However, there are many times when we do not need subsections, so we also use first-level and second-level headings to correspond to sections and titles, respectively, such as in the university theme.

```typst
#import "@preview/touying:0.6.1": *
#import themes.university: *

#show: university-theme.with(aspect-ratio: "16-9")

= Section

== Title

Hello, Touying!
```

In fact, we can control this behavior through the `slide-level` parameter of the `config-common` function. `slide-level` represents the complexity of the nesting structure, starting from 0. For example, `#show: university-theme.with(config-common(slide-level: 2))` is equivalent to both `section` and `subsection` creating new slides; while `#show: university-theme.with(config-common(slide-level: 3))` is equivalent to `section`, `subsection`, and `subsubsection` all creating new slides.

## Numbering

To add numbering to sections and subsections, we simply use

```typst
#set heading(numbering: "1.1")
#show heading.where(level: 1): set heading(numbering: "1.")
```

This sets the default numbering to `1.1`, and the section corresponds to the numbering `1.`.

## Table of Contents

Displaying a table of contents in Touying is straightforward:

```typst
#import "@preview/touying:0.6.1": *
#import themes.simple: *
#import "@preview/numbly:0.1.0": numbly

#set heading(numbering: numbly("{1}.", default: "1.1"))

#show: simple-theme.with(aspect-ratio: "16-9")

= Section

== Subsection

#components.adaptive-columns(outline(indent: 1em))
```

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/2674a632-e881-432f-a212-a55bcc7207c1) 

The `outline(indent: 1em)` is a native Typst function for the table of contents. The `#components.adaptive-columns()` function ensures that the table of contents occupies only one page, adapting by setting `#columns(1, body)` or `#columns(2, body)`, and so on.

If you need a `outline` function that can display the current progress, you might consider using `#components.progressive-outline()` or `#components.custom-progressive-outline()`, as seen in the dewdrop theme.
