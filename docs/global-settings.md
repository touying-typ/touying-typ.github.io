# Global Settings

## Global Styles

For Touying, global styles refer to set rules or show rules that need to be applied everywhere, such as `#set text(size: 20pt)`.

Themes in Touying encapsulate some of their own global styles, which are placed in `#self.methods.init`. For example, the simple theme encapsulates:

```typst
config-methods(
  init: (self: none, body) => {
    set text(fill: self.colors.neutral-darkest, size: 25pt)
    show footnote.entry: set text(size: .6em)
    show strong: self.methods.alert.with(self: self)
    show heading.where(level: self.slide-level + 1): set text(1.4em)

    body
  },
)
```

If you are not a theme creator but simply want to add some of your own global styles to your slides, you can easily place them before or after `#show: xxx-theme.with()`. For example, the metropolis theme recommends that you add the following global styles yourself:

```typst
#set text(font: "Fira Sans", weight: "light", size: 20pt)
#show math.equation: set text(font: "Fira Math")
#set strong(delta: 100)
#set par(justify: true)
```

## Global Information

Like Beamer, Touying helps you better maintain global information through a unified API design, allowing you to easily switch between different themes. Global information is a typical example of this.

You can set the title, subtitle, author, date, and institution information of your slides with:

```typst
#let s = (s.methods.info)(
  self: s,
  title: [Title],
  subtitle: [Subtitle],
  author: [Authors],
  date: datetime.today(),
  institution: [Institution],
)
```

Later on, you can access them through `self.info`.

This information is generally used in the theme's `title-slide`, `header`, and `footer`, such as `#show: metropolis-theme.with(aspect-ratio: "16-9", footer: self => self.info.institution)`.

The `date` can accept `datetime` format and `content` format, and the date display format of the `datetime` format can be changed with:

```typc
config-common(datetime-format: "[year]-[month]-[day]")
```
